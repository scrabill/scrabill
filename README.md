# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end software engineer with a love for CSS, Javascript and documenting all of the things. In my spare time, I have fun [building games in React](https://github.com/scrabill/food-or-foe-react) and [good olâ€™ vanilla Javascript](https://github.com/scrabill/candy-crush).

## Currently, I'm...

 - Refreshing my knowledge of ES6 Javascript
 - Migrating my personal website to [11ty](11ty.dev)
 - Thinking of new games to build using emojis

## Also, I'm a nominee for Ruby on Rails Thinker of the Year.
