# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end software engineer with a love for CSS, Javascript and documenting all of the things. In my spare time, I have fun [building games in React](https://github.com/scrabill/food-or-foe-react) and good olâ€™ vanilla Javascript.

## Currently, I'm...

 - Refreshing my knowledge of ES6 Javascript basis
 - Experimenting with and modern CSS
 - Figure out how to work with SVG files
 - Thinking of new games to build using emojis
